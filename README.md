# AnyscreenWireless
Make any screen your second monitor... wireless and simple!

Its the simple script to fake dual screen on UBUNTU/LINUX and lunch TeamViewer so just made screen can be viewed from other device ;)

It accepts two arguments: screen width and height.
Example:
./second_screen.sh 800 600
